I introduced the Marick Test Matrix in the previous post. As much as I like it and have come to rely on it. One thing has always bugged me about the matrix: The terms Brian used to describe his horizontal axis seem, IMHO, obtuse. Instead, I prefer these simpler terms:

* Support Programming = Define Requirements
* Critique Product = Identify Defects

Given those changes, hereâ€™s my updated matrix:

I prefer these axes because now I can refer to each quadrant by a simple name:

* Business/Requirements
* Business/Defects
* Technology/Requirements
* Technology/Defects
