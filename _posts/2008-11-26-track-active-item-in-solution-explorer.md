Here's another one of those tips that I'm blogging just so that I won't forget it.

Under Tools/Options, in Projects and Solutions, Visual Studio 2005 and 2008 both
provide an option entitled "Track Active Item in Solution Explorer". This option
causes Visual Studio to select the active item (current open file) in Solution Explorer.

I find this an extremely useful option. It helps me maintain context when I'm
jumping from one open file to another while working on a complex problem. It
puzzles me as to why the Visual Studio team decided that this option should be
off by default.	 Oh, well. Now we both know how to use it.
