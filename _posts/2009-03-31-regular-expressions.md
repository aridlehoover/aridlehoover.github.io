Today, it offered up something I’d not seen before:  a concise [regular expressions cheat sheet](http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/) from Dave Child at [AddedBytes.com](http://www.addedbytes.com/). Check it out the next time you need to conjure a regular expression. Also worth note:  the site contains [several other cheat sheets](http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/), as well.
